PSA: I apologise if some of the sentences in this article will not make any sense. In order to meet the hackaton’s deadlines I am currently very much sleep deprived and my brain is not really responsive. I hope you get what I am trying to convey here and that I don’t make your brain tangle up with meaningless sentences. Have a good day :)

I am finally sitting on the train, on my way home, after what I can definitely say where the most intensive and most fulfilling days of the last couple of months. I was one of 120 lucky students who got to attend *VHacks*, the first ever Hackaton at the Vatican (that’s where the Pope lives for those not familiar with it). It was a real unbelievable experience that taught me a lot, allowed me to meet and discuss very interesting and actual themes with very smart people and it was crazy fun. If you ever happen to see something similar advertised somewhere, do not think one second about not applying; you will not regret it.

Almost everyone in the software development industry is chasing ideas that one tends to describe as _the next Google_, _the Uber for X_, or _the AirBNB for Y_, we rarely stop to think about how the technologies with which we work everyday might have an impact on some of the really hard problems that society is facing in this era of globalisation. This was the main goal of VHacks: how can we use *AR*, VR, AI, and whatever other buzzword you can think of, to help the less fortunate.

This was exactly what this hackaton was for: I don’t want to go too much into deep about what happened, the event was very widely covered by the press and you can probably find a lot of information with a quick [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduck.go) research. What I would much rather do here is think about the responsibilities that the 21st century’s tech industry has.

In my many years at school I had what I deem luck of studying many different cultures, from the Egyptians to the Greeks of Socrates, Platones and Aristoteles and the Romans to the cultural situation in Italy and Europe after the two world wars, which I also had the immense luck of hear narrated by my Grandfather. I remember that during my first history classes in primary school I asked our teacher why did we have to memorise all these informations (yes, I was a very annoying kid, don’t judge me) (also, I did not really change in my later life, sorry) and I still and always will remember her answer: ***we study history because by knowing where we come from we can understand who we are and, most importantly, we can understand where we have to go***. Now that was a really deep sentence and 6 years old me did not really understand what it meant, he probably shrugged his shoulders and went on asking more and more questions, but I somehow stored that sentence in my brain drive and as I started growing up I kept going back to it and during the study and discovery of all the various world cultures, I finally started understanding its meaning.

Even with our infinite flaws, we are the most advanced living being on Planet Earth and we managed to achieve results that our ancestors could not even begin to understand (flying some metal pieces into the sky and have them return to the planet landing at the exact same time in the exact spot you wanted to land them. I still get goose bumps when I think about watching live), and we managed to achieve them by learning from our ancestors life, from their successes and from their errors.

The technology industry in the last two decades contributed to solving many problems and shaping our society in a major way, but there is still a lot that it could do (and that it should do) to help out people in critical situations. We are the industry that is shaping the society of the 22nd century: we must not forgot that as long as we are not able to solve the problems that inhibit everyone from having an even playing field, that stop us from having discussions among ourselves, as long as we have people that are willing to risk everything that they have got for the 1% chance of improving their families life, we will never reach our full potential.

These three days made me realise that I do not want to spend the unbelievable chance that I was given by not making sure that we advance as humanity, the people I met inspired me to do much more than I am currently doing, I learned about so many new subjects whilst sleeping so little that I think my brain could explode at any second but, most importantly, the got me unbelievably excited about working on something that I would have never thought about.

I hope that at least a small part of the other students that were with me at this event feel in the same way and I hope that this VHacks was just the first of a long series of events. We are jumpstarting something that has the potential to be one of the most important cultural trends of this century and that will be seen by our descendants like as the turning point for us, were we overcame what so far stopped us from achieving the unachievable and I will definitely do my best to make it so.

Let me now spend a couple of words to say thanks to the organisers of this event and with them whoever made it possible, to my amazing teammates who somehow managed to deal with my craziness after 24 straight hours of coding and way too many red bulls, to my two team mentors who both sparked the thoughts that led to this blog post and who helped me take a break from everything when I needed it, and to everyone else that I got to meet here in Rome: the memories of these three days will always bring a smile on my face and warmth in my heart, thank you.
